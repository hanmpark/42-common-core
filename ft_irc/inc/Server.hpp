 * Server class:
 * - Server class is responsible for creating a socket, accepting connections, receiving and sending data.
 * - It containes all of the information about the server.
 * - It has a private attribute _clients to keep track of all the clients connected to the server, as well as manage their requests.
 * - It contains as well a list of pollfds.
 * pollfds = is used for manipulating file descriptors in order to handle I/O events
 * That way, instead of waiting for a single event coming from one client,
 * we can handle more events simultaneously in an effective way using the struct.
 * Which prevents the block events.
