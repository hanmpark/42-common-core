# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest!
This repository is a **personal monorepo** of my projects from the [42 school](https://42nice.fr/) Common Core curriculum.

## Can I contribute?

❌ External contributions are **not accepted**.
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Preserve the commit history of my 42 projects
- Showcase them in one place
- Track my scores and progress

## Issues

You’re welcome to open an issue if you:
- Notice something broken in the repo structure
- Have questions about a specific project

But please note that this repository is **not actively developed**.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests will generally not be merged, since the projects are snapshots of my work during the curriculum.

✨ Thanks for understanding!
