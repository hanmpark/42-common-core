# cpp_modules

The cpp_modules at 42 are designed to introduce students to the C++ programming language and provide them with a solid foundation in its concepts and syntax. These modules aim to equip students with the skills necessary to tackle more complex programming challenges and enhance their programming abilities.

## Goals
The cpp_modules have the following goals:

1. **Introduce C++**: The modules aim to familiarize students with the C++ programming language, its features, and its advantages over other programming languages.

2. **Build a Strong Foundation**: Students will learn about essential C++ concepts such as data types, control structures, functions, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and more. The modules are structured in a progressive manner, starting from the basics and gradually building up to more advanced concepts.

3. **Develop Object-Oriented Programming Skills**: The cpp_modules emphasize object-oriented programming principles and techniques. Students will learn how to design and implement classes, use inheritance and polymorphism to create flexible and reusable code, and leverage templates for generic programming.

4. **Enhance Problem-Solving Abilities**: By completing the cpp_modules, students will gain experience in solving programming challenges using C++. They will learn how to analyze problems, design efficient algorithms, and implement solutions using the language's features and libraries.

5. **Prepare for Advanced Topics**: The modules serve as a stepping stone for students to delve into more advanced topics in C++ and related fields, such as game development, system programming, and high-performance computing.


## Who Can Benefit
Whether you are a beginner with no prior programming experience or an experienced programmer looking to expand your skill set, the cpp_modules will help you unlock the power of the C++ language. The modules are designed to accommodate learners at different levels and provide a comprehensive understanding of C++.
