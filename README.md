## 🛠️ How this repo works

- Each project was imported as a **subtree**, preserving its commit history.
- To update all projects from their original repositories:
  ```bash
  make update
  ```
- to update a single project:
  ```bash
  make one NAME=<remote>
  # e.g.
  make one NAME=minishell
  ```
> Tip: run `make remotes` to see configured remotes, and `make ensure-remotes` once on a fresh clone.
